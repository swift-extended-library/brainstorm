# Brainstorm

## Scattered Thoughts

- Two approaches
  - single repository with subfolders for different "libraries"
  - one repository per library
- seed repositories/folders that we want to see built. initial thoughts:
  - data structures
  - regular expressions
  - paths
  - CLI arg parsing
  - observables?
  - http?
  - logging strategies for SwiftLog?
- use the forums as a source of ideas for things that have been rejected or deferred from the standard library
- is there a way to make templates for repositories, so that providing a library name will automatically generate the proper folder structure, package manager files, etc?
